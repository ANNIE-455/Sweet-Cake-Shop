Week 1: Local Environment Setup

Student Reflection
I mastered setting up a local full-stack development environment using the XAMPP stack. I successfully managed Apache and MySQL core services. My main technical challenge was resolving an initial port conflict for Apache, which I fixed by modifying the service configurations.
Week 2:Wireframes and GUI Design

Student Reflection
This week helped me understand how the frontend and backend work together. JavaScript was used on the frontend to validate user input and provide immediate feedback, improving the user experience before data is sent to the server. PHP handled the backend processing of form data and dynamic user input. 

Week 3: JavaScript and PHP Basics
Frontend Interaction and Backend Foundations

Figure 9 Javascript form validation

Figure 10 php sytax 

Figure 11 Dynamic use input dashboard
Student reflection
The figures demonstrate JavaScript DOM manipulation preventing invalid inputs before reaching the server, reducing unnecessary HTTP requests. PHP was used to securely process the incoming POST request .The mysqli connection bridges the frontend inputs to the MySQL database, establishing the foundational architecture for the stateless registration system.

Week 4 Task Schedule
Task 1 – Understanding Server-Side Programming

Task 2 – HTML Forms and PHP Integration

Figure 14 Login form

Figure 15 Registration form
Task 3 – Simple Authentication System

Figure 17 Username/password validation

Figure 18session-based welcome page



Task 4 – Backend Folder Organization

Task 5 – Introduction to Modern Backend 

Figure 20 php modern alternative
Student reflection
PHP handles the secure transfer of registration data. By bypassing session storage entirely to meet project requirements, the system strictly relies on processing direct payloads.Security was prioritized by using real_escape_string`to protect against basic SQL injection before executing the database insertion.
Week 5 Lesson – Advanced Web Design and Development
Task 1-Database creation

Figure 21 Cake Database
Task 2- Creating tables

Figure 22 Cake table
Task 3- CRAD operations

Figure 23 Add records(INSERT)




Figure 24 Delete records(DELETE)
Student reflection
The MySQL database ensures permanent data persistence. The database schema includes an auto-incrementing primary key and timestamp to track registration order. The final integration immediately fetches and displays real-time registration data via a dynamically generated  table directly after form submission, fully completing the stateless flow.
