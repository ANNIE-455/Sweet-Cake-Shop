# Database Structure

Database Name:
cake_db

## Table: users

| Field    | Type         | Description     |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| id       | INT          | Primary Key     |
| username | VARCHAR(100) | User Name       |
| email    | VARCHAR(100) | User Email      |
| password | VARCHAR(255) | Hashed Password |

SQL:

CREATE TABLE users (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);


# Authentication Workflow

1. User enters registration details.
2. Password is hashed using PASSWORD_DEFAULT.
3. User information is stored in MySQL.
4. User logs in.
5. Password is verified using password_verify().
6. Access is granted if credentials are correct.



# Session Management

The system can be extended using PHP sessions.

Example:

session_start();

$_SESSION['username'] = $row['username'];

Benefits:

* Maintains logged-in user state.
* Prevents unauthorized access.
* Supports logout functionality.
